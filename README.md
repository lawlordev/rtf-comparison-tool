# RTF Comparison Tool

Compare two RTF files and report exactly how their **content** differs — ignoring
cosmetic formatting (fonts, colours, column widths, spacing). Built in **R** for
clinical QC of TLF (Tables, Listings, Figures) outputs, but general enough for any
tabular RTF.

> **Why not just `diff` the files?** RTF is markup. Two RTF files that render the
> *identical* table can have completely different bytes (font tables, control-word
> order, escape encodings). A raw text `diff` produces thousands of meaningless
> differences. This tool extracts the **displayed cell content**, normalises it, and
> compares **cell by cell**, e.g. *"Row 10, Col 2: file 1 = `45 (21.4%)`, file 2 =
> `46 (21.9%)`"*.

## What you need

- **R** (version 4.x), already installed. Download: <https://cran.r-project.org>.
  No programming knowledge is required to *use* the tool.
- A one-time install of five R packages (handled for you in Step 1 below):
  `striprtf`, `diffdf`, `data.table`, `testthat`, `optparse`.
- The package install needs an internet connection the first time only.

---

## Quick start

Use the launcher folder for your computer — `windows\` on Windows, `macos/` on a Mac.
Double-click to set up once; then, to compare, you paste two file paths (or use the
file-picker alternative, `2b-…`).

### Step 1 — install the packages (once)

| Windows | Mac |
|---|---|
| Double-click **`windows\1-Install-Packages.bat`** | Double-click **`macos/1-Install-Packages.command`** |

A window opens, installs the five packages, prints **`SUCCESS`**, and waits for a key
press. You only ever do this once per computer.

### Step 2 — compare two files (every time)

| Windows | Mac |
|---|---|
| Double-click **`windows\2-Compare-RTF-Files.bat`** | Double-click **`macos/2-Compare-RTF-Files.command`** |

It prompts for two file paths — **paste or type each path and press Enter** (in Windows
Explorer, Shift + right-click a file → *Copy as path*):

```
File 1 (reference)  : <paste the first path>
File 2 (comparison) : <paste the second path>
```

Backslash paths and surrounding quotes are both handled. The result appears immediately —
**EQUIVALENT** or **N difference(s) found** (each difference listed). **Nothing is saved
automatically**; it then asks whether to export the report as **TXT**, **CSV**, or **both**,
and prompts for where to save it (type a full path or a folder). Finally it offers to
compare another pair. Works with any two RTF files on the machine.

> **Prefer clicking files in a dialog?** Use `2b-Compare-Using-File-Picker.bat` /
> `2b-Compare-Using-File-Picker.command` instead — same result, file-picker dialogs rather
> than pasted paths.

---

## Compare whole folders at once (batch)

To QC a whole set of tables in one go, compare two **folders** instead of two files:

| Windows | Mac |
|---|---|
| Double-click **`windows\2c-Compare-Folders.bat`** | Double-click **`macos/2c-Compare-Folders.command`** |

Two folder pickers open — choose the **reference** folder, then the **comparison** folder.
The tool compares **every `.rtf` file** in the first folder against the file of the **same
name** in the second folder, and produces **one report that lists every file** — including the
ones that are **EQUIVALENT** — so the report is a complete record of the set:

```
PER-FILE RESULTS  (every file is listed, including matches):
FILE            RESULT
table_14-1.rtf  EQUIVALENT
table_14-2.rtf  7 difference(s)
table_14-3.rtf  ONLY IN FOLDER 1 (no match)
```

Files that differ have their cell-level differences listed underneath; files present in only
one folder (or that can't be read) are flagged rather than silently skipped. The full report
is **archived automatically** inside the tool's `logs/reports/` folder (a `.txt` and a `.csv`),
and you're also offered a **Save dialog** to keep your own copy wherever you like. The two
folders must use **matching file names** for files to be paired.

---

## Audit log — proof of every run

**Every** comparison you run — single-file *or* batch, **including runs that find no
differences** — is appended to a timestamped audit log:

```
logs/audit_log.csv
```

One row per run records *when* it ran, *who* ran it, the files or folders compared, the result,
and the counts (files compared / equivalent / differing / errors). Open it in **Excel** or
**Numbers** to review, sort, or print it as evidence of the QC work performed and when.

| Windows | Mac |
|---|---|
| Double-click **`windows\5-View-Audit-Log.bat`** | Double-click **`macos/5-View-Audit-Log.command`** |

The audit log and the archived reports live **inside the tool folder** (`logs/`). See
`logs/README.txt` for the column definitions.

---

## Keep the tool folder intact

> ⚠️ **Do not move the R scripts or launchers out of the tool folder.** The tool writes its
> **audit log** and **archived reports** to the `logs/` folder that sits next to the `R/`
> folder. If you split the folder up, the tool can no longer find `logs/` and cannot save your
> audit trail. Keep the whole folder together (you can put the *whole* folder anywhere — Desktop,
> a network share, a USB drive — just don't take pieces out of it).

---

> **No admin rights / "Run anyway" is blocked (Windows):** that prompt is triggered because
> downloaded files are "blocked". Clear it yourself without admin: right-click the **ZIP** →
> **Properties** → tick **Unblock** → **OK**, *then* extract. If your company blocks `.bat`
> files entirely, drive the tool from the R console instead (no admin, always works):
> `source("C:/path/to/rtf-comparison-tool/R/run_compare_paths.R")` then paste the two paths.
> See `START HERE (Windows).txt` for the full no-admin walkthrough.

> **Mac, first run only:** macOS may say the file is "from an unidentified developer."
> Right-click the `.command` → **Open** → **Open**. If a launcher isn't clickable, run
> `chmod +x *.command` once in the `macos` folder.

> **Tip:** keep the whole folder together — the launchers find the R scripts via their own
> location, so the tool works from anywhere (Desktop, network share, USB drive).

## What the report tells you

**Console / text report (always produced):**

```
============================================================
RTF COMPARISON REPORT
============================================================
File 1:  examples/clinical_table_base.rtf
File 2:  examples/clinical_table_changed.rtf
Options: num_tol=0, rel_tol=FALSE, trim=TRUE, collapse_space=TRUE, casefold=FALSE
Cells compared: 3,202
Result:  7 DIFFERENCE(S) FOUND
------------------------------------------------------------
ROW   COL   STATUS               FILE 1 VALUE          FILE 2 VALUE
3     1     VALUE_DIFF           Safety Population     Safety Population (Final)
10    2     VALUE_DIFF           45 (21.4%)            46 (21.9%)
10    4     VALUE_DIFF           52 (24.5%)            53 (25.0%)
11    6     VALUE_DIFF           (-1.2 to 3.4)         (-1.0 to 3.6)
15    5     VALUE_DIFF           31 (4.9%)             32 (5.1%)
20    1     VALUE_DIFF           Fatigue               Fatigues
542   1     VALUE_DIFF           ...Pharmaceuticals... ...Pharma...
```

**Each difference is classified:**

| STATUS | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VALUE_DIFF` | The cell exists in both files but the content differs. |
| `CELL_ONLY_IN_FILE1` | The cell exists only in file 1 (e.g. file 1 has an extra row or column). |
| `CELL_ONLY_IN_FILE2` | The cell exists only in file 2. |

`ROW`/`COL` are 1-based positions counted top-to-bottom (titles, subtitles, table rows
and footnotes are all numbered in the order they appear; non-table lines are a single
"column 1").

**CSV (`.csv`):** the same differences as data — columns
`row_index, col_index, status, value_file1, value_file2` — ready for Excel or a pipeline.

---

## Command-line use (optional)

For power users, pipelines, or batch QC. From the project folder:

```bash
Rscript R/compare_rtf.R --file1 path/to/base.rtf --file2 path/to/comparison.rtf
```

The comparison result always prints to the screen; **nothing is written to disk unless you
ask**. Export on demand by naming where each file should go — `--report` for the text report,
`--csv` for the differences:

```bash
Rscript R/compare_rtf.R \
  --file1 base.rtf --file2 comparison.rtf \
  --report result.txt --csv diffs.csv --diffdf
```

**Exit codes** (useful for automation):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Files are **equivalent** (no content differences). |
| `1` | One or more **differences** found. |
| `2` | **Error** (file not found, not a valid RTF, bad arguments). |

Run `Rscript R/compare_rtf.R --help` for the full option list.

---

## Options and defaults

| Option (CLI) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--num-tol <n>` | `0` (exact) | Numeric tolerance. If `> 0`, two cells that both parse as numbers (ignoring `,` and a trailing `%`) and differ by `≤ n` are treated as a match. |
| `--rel-tol` | off | Interpret `--num-tol` as a *relative* tolerance (fraction of the larger value). |
| `--no-collapse-space` | off | Keep internal runs of whitespace instead of collapsing them to one space. |
| `--casefold` | off | Case-insensitive comparison. |
| `--report <path>` | — | Also write the text report to a file. |
| `--csv <path>` | — | Write the differences as CSV. |
| `--diffdf` | off | Also run a second, independent comparison with the `diffdf` package and print whether it agrees. |

Defaults match the confirmed clinical requirements: **exact** comparison, whitespace
trimmed and collapsed, case preserved, and **titles/subtitles/footnotes are compared**
(not just the table body). Special characters (©, ≥, °, µ, α, β, accents, en/minus dashes)
are decoded and compared exactly.

---

## Generate your own test data

You can create realistic synthetic clinical RTF files to experiment with — no Python,
just R.

**Easy way:** double-click **`windows\4-Generate-Test-Data.bat`** /
**`macos/4-Generate-Test-Data.command`**, pick an output folder. It writes three files and
prints a self-check:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `clinical_table_base.rtf` | The reference table. |
| `clinical_table_reformatted.rtf` | **Same content, different formatting** → must compare **EQUIVALENT** to base. |
| `clinical_table_changed.rtf` | Base with **7 deliberate content edits** → must compare to base as **7 differences**. |

**Command line** (with control over size and seed):

```bash
Rscript R/generate_test_data.R --out my_test_files            # default ~70 rows
Rscript R/generate_test_data.R --out big_files --rows 50000   # large file for speed testing
Rscript R/generate_test_data.R --out repro --seed 12345       # reproducible
```

After generating, compare `base` against `reformatted` (expect EQUIVALENT) and against
`changed` (expect 7 differences) to see the tool in action.

---

## Run the test suite

A full automated suite (171 checks) verifies every part of the tool against small
hand-built fixtures, the large clinical example files, **and** real-world clinical
outputs (see `tests/real_world/`).

**Easy way:** double-click **`windows\3-Run-Tests.bat`** / **`macos/3-Run-Tests.command`**.

**Command line:**

```bash
Rscript R/run_tests.R
```

You should see `RESULT: 171 passed, 0 failed`. The suite covers parsing, normalisation,
all five difference types, numeric tolerance, the report/CSV/exit codes, edge cases
(byte-identical fast path, non-RTF input, trailing empty rows), a large-file performance
check, the two key integration expectations (base↔reformatted EQUIVALENT;
base↔changed = 7 differences), real-world clinical files (`tests/real_world/`), the
**batch folder comparison** (every file listed, including matches), and the **audit log**
(every run recorded, including no-difference runs).

---

## How it works

Three independent stages (each separately tested):

```
  RTF file ──► (1) PARSE ──► tall table: one row per cell (row_index, col_index, raw_value)
                  │                 (via striprtf: decodes code page, \'XX and \uN escapes,
                  │                  and table row/cell structure)
                  ▼
              (2) NORMALIZE ──► trim + collapse whitespace, NBSP→space  ──► norm_value
                  │
                  ▼
              (3) COMPARE ──► full outer join of the two tables on (row_index, col_index),
                              classify each cell, summarise, write report + exit code
```

Because rows and cells are matched **positionally**, the approach works for tables of any
shape (any number of columns) with no assumptions, and row/column count mismatches simply
fall out as `CELL_ONLY_IN_FILEn` entries. The comparison uses a fast `data.table` keyed
join so it scales to large files. As an independent cross-check, the `diffdf` package (the
R analogue of SAS `PROC COMPARE`, widely trusted in pharma QC) can corroborate the result.

---

## What has been validated

- **Content, not markup:** `clinical_table_base.rtf` vs `clinical_table_reformatted.rtf`
  → **EQUIVALENT**, even though the two files differ on thousands of lines of RTF markup.
- **Real differences are caught precisely:** `base` vs `clinical_table_changed.rtf`
  → **exactly 7 differences** at the correct cells, including a subtitle change and a
  footnote change (proving non-table text is compared).
- **Special characters** decode correctly from both `\'XX` (Windows-1252) and `\uN`
  (Unicode) escapes: ©, ≥, −, °, µ, α, β, –, é, ü.
- **Robustness:** byte-identical files short-circuit instantly; non-RTF/empty input gives a
  clear error (not a stack trace); a trailing blank row in one file does not create spurious
  differences; CRLF and LF line endings are treated the same.

See `docs/RTF_Compare_Implementation_Plan_R.md` for the full build specification and
`examples/README.md` for details of the provided example files.

---

## Known limitations

- **Merged / spanned cells** can shift positional column alignment; such cases are reported
  as mismatches rather than resolved.
- **Embedded images, drawing objects, deeply nested tables** are out of scope — text is
  extracted, objects are ignored.
- **Unicode canonical normalisation is intentionally *not* applied** (comparison is exact),
  so visually similar but distinct code points (e.g. micro sign µ vs Greek mu μ) are
  reported as different — which is correct for exact QC.
- **Very large files:** typical clinical TLF files (a few thousand rows) compare in well
  under a second. Tens of thousands of rows take longer because the RTF parser (`striprtf`)
  is pure R. For genuinely huge datasets, compare the **source data** that produced the RTF
  rather than the rendered RTF.
- **SAS version** is out of scope for now; the architecture is language-agnostic and could
  be ported later.
